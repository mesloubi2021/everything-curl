# HTTP with curl

In all user surveys and during all curl's lifetime, HTTP has been the most
important and most frequently used protocol that curl supports. This chapter
explains how to do effective HTTP transfers and general fiddling with curl.

This mostly works the same way for HTTPS, as they are really the same thing
under the hood, as HTTPS is HTTP with an extra security TLS layer. See also
the specific [HTTPS](#https) section below.
