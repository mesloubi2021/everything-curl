# Modify the HTTP request

As described earlier, each HTTP transfer starts with curl sending an HTTP
request. That request consists of a request line and a number of request
headers, and this chapter details how you can modify all of those.

* [Request method](method.md)
* [Request target](target.md)
* [Fragment](fragment.md)
* [Customize headers](headers.md)
* [Referer](referer.md)
* [User-agent](user-agent.md)

Of course, changing the [HTTP version](../versions/) is another way to alter
the request.
