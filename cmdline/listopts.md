# List options

curl has more than two hundred and fifty command-line options and the number
of options keep increasing over time. Chances are the number of options
reaches or even surpasses three hundred in the coming years.

To find out which options you need to perform as certain action, you can get
curl to list them. First, `curl --help` or simply `curl -h` get you a list of
the most important and frequently used options. You can then provide an
additional "category" to `-h` to get more options listed for that specific
area. Use `curl -h category` to list all existing categories or `curl -h all`
to list *all* available options.

The `curl --manual` option outputs the entire man page for curl. That is a
thorough and complete document on how each option works amassing several
thousand lines of documentation. To wade through that is also a tedious work
and we encourage use of a search function through those text masses. Some
people might also appreciate the man page in its
[web version](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html).
