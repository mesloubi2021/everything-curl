## Installing prebuilt binaries

There are many friendly people and organizations who put together binary
packages of curl and libcurl and make them available for download.

Many operating systems offer a "package repository" that is populated with
software packages for you to install. From the [curl download
page](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) you can also follow links to plain
binary packages for popular operating systems.

## Installing from your package repository

curl and libcurl have been around for a very long time and most Linux
distributions, BSD versions and other *nix versions have package repositories
that allow you to install curl packages.

The most common ones are described below.

### apt

`apt` is a tool to install prebuilt packages on Debian Linux and Ubuntu Linux
distributions and derivatives.

To install the curl command-line tool, you usually just

    apt install curl

â€¦and that then makes sure the dependencies are installed and usually
libcurl is then also installed as an individual package.

If you want to build applications against libcurl, you need a development
package installed to get the include headers and some additional
documentation, etc. You can then select a libcurl with the TLS backend you
prefer:

    apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev

or

    apt install libcurl4-nss-dev

or

    apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev

### yum

With Redhat Linux and CentOS Linux derivatives, you use `yum` to install
packages. Install the command-line tool with:

    yum install curl

You install the libcurl development package (with include files and some docs,
etc.) with this:

    yum install curl-devel

(The Redhat family of Linux systems usually ship curl built to use NSS as TLS
backend.)


### nix

[Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) is a package manager default to the NixOS distribution, but it can also be used on any Linux distribution. 

In order to install command-line tool:

    nix-env -i curl

### homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an OSX package manager. It does not come by default, but one can install it easily.

To install the command-line tool:

    brew install curl
