# Modify the HTTP request

As described earlier, each HTTP transfer starts with curl sending a HTTP
request. That request consists of a request line and a number of request
headers, and this chapter details how you can modify all of those.

## Request method

The first line of the request includes the *method* - sometimes also referred
to as "the verb". When doing a simple GET request as this command line would
do:

    curl http://example.com/file

â€¦the initial request line looks like this:

    GET /file HTTP/1.1

You can tell curl to change the method into something else by using the `-X`
or `--request` command-line options followed by the actual method name. You
can, for example, send a `DELETE` instead of `GET` like this:

    curl http://example.com/file -X DELETE

This command-line option only changes the text in the outgoing request, it
does not change any behavior. This is particularly important if you, for
example, ask curl to send a HEAD with `-X`, as HEAD is specified to send all
the headers a GET response would get but *never* send a response body, even if
the headers otherwise imply that one would come. So, adding `-X HEAD` to a
command line that would otherwise do a GET will cause curl to hang, waiting
for a response body that won't come.

When asking curl to perform HTTP transfers, it will pick the correct method
based on the option so you should only very rarely have to explicitly ask for
it with `-X`. It should also be noted that when curl follows redirects like
asked to with `-L`, the request method set with `-X` will be sent even on the
subsequent redirects.

## Request target

In the example above, you can see how the path section of the URL gets turned
into `/file` in the request line. That is called the "request target". That's
the resource this request will interact with. Normally this request target is
extracted from the URL and then used in the request and as a user you don't
need to think about it.

In some rare circumstances, user may want to go creative and change this
request target in ways that the URL doesn't really allow. For example, the
HTTP OPTIONS method has a specially define request target for magic that
concerns *the server* and not a specific path, and it uses `*` for that. Yes,
a single asterisk. There's no way to specify a URL for this, so if you want to
pass a single asterisk in the request target to a server, like for OPTIONS,
you have to do it like this:

    curl -X OPTIONS --request-target "*" http://example.com/

## Anchors or fragments

A URL may contain an anchor, also known as a fragment, which is written with a
pound sign and string at the end of the URL. Like for example
`http://example.com/foo.html#here-it-is`. That fragment part, everything from
the pound/hash sign to the end of the URL, is only intend for local use and
will not be sent over the network. curl will simply strip that data off and
discard it.

## Customize headers

In a HTTP request, after the initial request-line, there will typically follow
a number of request headers. That's a set of `name: value` pairs that ends
with a blank line that separates the headers from the following request body
(that sometimes is empty).

curl will by default and on its own account pass a few headers in requests,
like for example `Host:`, `Accept:`, `User-Agent:` and a few others that may
depend on what the user asks curl to do.

All headers set by curl itself can be overridden, replaced if you will, by the
user. You just then tell curl's `-H` or `--header` the new header to use and
it will then replace the internal one if the header field matches one of those
headers, or it will add the specified header to the list of headers to send in
the request.

To change the `Host:` header, do this:

    curl -H "Host: test.example" http://example.com/

To add a `Elevator: floor-9` header, do this:

    curl -H "Elevator: floor-9" http://example.com/

If you just want to delete an internally generated header, just give it to
curl without a value, just nothing on the right side of the colon.

To switch off the `User-Agent:` header, do this:

    curl -H "User-Agent:" http://example.com/

Finally, if you then truly want to add a header with no contents on the right
side of the colon (which is a rare thing), the magic marker for that is to
instead end the header field name with a *semicolon*. Like this:

    curl -H "Empty;" http://example.com

## Referer

When a user clicks on a link on a web page and the browser takes the user away
to the next URL, it will send the new URL a "referer" header in the new
request telling it where it came from. That is the referer header. And yes,
referer is misspelled but that's how it is supposed to be!

With curl you set the referer header with `-e` or `--referer`, like this:

    curl --referer http://comes-from.example.com https://www.example.com/

## User-agent

The User-Agent is a header that each client can set in the request to inform
the server which user-agent it is. Sometimes servers will look at this header
and determine how to act based on its contents.

The default header value is 'curl/[version]', as in `User-Agent: curl/7.54.1`
for curl version 7.54.1.

You can set any value you like, using the option `-A` or `--user-agent` plus
the string to use or, as it's just a header, `-H "User-Agent: foobar/2000"`.

As comparison, a recent test version of Firefox on a Linux machine sent this
User-Agent header:

`User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0`

## --time-cond
